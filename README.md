# Data Structures
These are my assignments for the data structures course. Even though all of them are tested with large data sets (500k) and pass the calico tests, they are not the best code out there. Since these were my first coding assignments, I made many inefficient choices during coding. I will continue upgrading and adding new features. Most of the upgrades I want to make are written as comments. 

The solutions aim to read the data sets from the file. Then make additions/removals, and update the data according to another file called the operations file. The structures I have used in the solutions are array, binary search tree, double pointer skiplist, four pointer skiplist, file I/O, singly linked list, standard library list, standard library map, and finally standard library vector. To compare their efficiency, the "time" lines I commented can be used. 

The features I want to add include a "fancy" print function that will print the data visually (e.g. like a tree). Another thing that I would like to add is the header files or modules which will increase the readability of the code. Also, I did not use functions very often which I should consider doing so.
